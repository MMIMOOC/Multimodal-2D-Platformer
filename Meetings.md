- Discussed different game ideas
  - Momchil suggested a 3D shooter game with keyboard and mouse as input devices IF they are considered two different modalities
  - Georgi suggested a spaceship game - this will not work, because a mouse doesn't make shooting easier in this scenario, we simply shoot with a keyboard button and then keep moving forward
- We agreed on everyone trying out Unity in the next couple of days
- Unclear whether keyboard and mouse are two different modalities - Momchil will attend the Q&A and will ask
- Can we use game templates and modify them to our needs? - Momchil will ask in the Q&A

**13.06.2022 - Q&A Session**
- Using a template is allowed and even advisable, so we make it within the time frame of the project
- Keyboard and mouse **ARE NOT** two different modalities - so we have to come up with a new game scenario that includes keyboard and voice input
- Focus is on incorporating the different modalities in a game rather than on developing a complex scenario, so we don't need to start implementing from scratch

**05.07.2022**
- Discussed how the bullet counter is changed in the `PlayerAttack.cs` script
- Discussed how we can go about the modality fission
  - We will add a timer that lasts 2 seconds while reloading
  - This timer is added as a UI Text object (Georgi demonstrated how to do this)
  - After the timer runs out, the player can shoot again
