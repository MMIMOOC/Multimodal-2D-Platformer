This is a short introduction on how to use Github and Unity:
1. Clone this r–µpository on your computer
2. You will find the game folder in the repo, open it with unity

4. Now you can change whatever you have to in Unity or in the code editor (**!Always pull before changing!**)
5. When you are ready with the changes, do not forget to push them :)
